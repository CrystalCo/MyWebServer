TO RUN TELNET:
I installed the telnet application using homebrew:
> brew install telnet

After it finished installing, I tested it by entering:
> telnet condor.depaul.edu 80

Then I ran the depaul hostname and web server port, as provided in the instructions:

        Crystals-MacBook:MyWebServer crystalcontreras$ telnet condor.depaul.edu 80
        Trying 216.220.180.150...
        Connected to condor.depaul.edu.
        Escape character is '^]'.

I gave telnet the following input:

        http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/cat.html

This is the HTTP response I received:

        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Date: Sun, 06 Oct 2019 19:33:24 GMT
        Server: Apache
        Content-Length: 226
        Connection: close
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
        <html><head>
        <title>400 Bad Request</title>
        </head><body>
        <h1>Bad Request</h1>
        <p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />
        </p>
        </body></html>
        Connection closed by foreign host.

Apparently, I was not the only student to get this response. 
Also, Telnet did not provide lines for "Last-Modified", "Etag", or "Accept-Ranges: bytes" like
the example provided in our assignment:
Last-Modified: Wed, 07 Oct 2015 20:29:55 GMT
ETag: "8a1bfc-30-521899bff76c0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
