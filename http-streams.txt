TO RUN TELNET:
I installed the telnet application using homebrew:
> brew install telnet

After it finished installing, I tested it by entering:
> telnet condor.depaul.edu 80

Then I ran the depaul hostname and web server port, as provided in the instructions:

        Crystals-MacBook:MyWebServer cc$ telnet condor.depaul.edu 80
        Trying 216.220.180.150...
        Connected to condor.depaul.edu.
        Escape character is '^]'.

I gave telnet the following input:

        http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/cat.html

This is the HTTP response I received:

        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Date: Sun, 06 Oct 2019 19:33:24 GMT
        Server: Apache
        Content-Length: 226
        Connection: close
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
        <html><head>
        <title>400 Bad Request</title>
        </head><body>
        <h1>Bad Request</h1>
        <p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />
        </p>
        </body></html>
        Connection closed by foreign host.

Apparently, I was not the only student to get this response. 
Also, Telnet did not provide lines for "Last-Modified", "Etag", or "Accept-Ranges: bytes" like
the example provided in our assignment:
    Last-Modified: Wed, 07 Oct 2015 20:29:55 GMT
    ETag: "8a1bfc-30-521899bff76c0"
    Accept-Ranges: bytes




Next, I ran MyWebServer:
> java MyWebServer

On the Firefox browser's url, I entered:     
http://localhost:2540/TEST

In this case, FF is the Client and MyWebServer is the web server/browser.
This is the request MyWebServer received from the FF browser CL:

    Crystals-MacBook:MyWebServer cc$ java MyWebServer
        Clark Elliott's MyWebServer Listener 1.8 starting up, listening at port 2540.

        GET /TEST HTTP/1.1
        Host: localhost:2540
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0
        Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
        Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
        Connection: keep-alive
        Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1



So telnet is a Client that sent a request to a web server/browser (Port: 80) and 
reeived the following RESPONSE from the server/browser:
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Date: Sun, 06 Oct 2019 19:33:24 GMT
        Server: Apache
        Content-Length: 226
        Connection: close
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">

        </head><body>
        <h1>Bad Request</h1>
        <p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.<br />
        </p>
        </body></html>
        Connection closed by foreign host.
